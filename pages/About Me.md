# Experience

#### UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER | UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO, RIO PIEDRAS 
 **SEPT '17 — PRESENT &#124;** Applying computer vision and machine learning for the automatization of the detection, identification and tracking of bees to analyze their behavior. I work developing a technique to identifying untagged bee in videos using unsupervised learning and Siamese network.

#### UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER | UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ
 **JUNE 18 — AUG '18 &#124;** Improved a module that predicts the probability of being wrong of mapping read into a variation graph called vg. I work building and benchmarks models to improve the predictions the probabilities of being wrong of mapping reads into the vg. 

#### FULL-STACK DEVELOPER INTERN | VESO
 **MAY '16 — SEPT '16 &#124;** Automatizing the company's booking system getting a speed improvement. I design and implement the logistics to manage users and services, making faster the offered services by a factor of four and saving hours of data entries.


#### UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHER | UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO, RIO PIEDRAS
 **NOV '16 — JULY '17 &#124;** Built a real-time web interface to investigate better ways to improve architectural planning critics workflow. Redesigning an interface for the creation of architectural planning critics and making real-time, resulting in a three times faster interface and more intuitive UI.

#### RESEARCH INTERN | iGenApps
 **SEPT '16 — DEC '16 &#124;** Built an augmented reality interface to investigate how to improve mobiles apps creation workflows. Develop a real-time API for creation of a new method of designing mobile apps with the Microsoft Hololens.
